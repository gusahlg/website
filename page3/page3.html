        <p class="p">Hey welcome to CookieCraft! This is mainly a Minecraft community whose primary cause is to have you entertained and make people have a good time. CookieCraft also refers to an actually Minecraft server too. This server is the server that most assosiated content creation is made on. Other than being a tool and extension of the CookieCraft community (proud patriotic CC moment) the website is also a just generally cool chill place to be and provides entertainment on it's own such as some cool games. Massive thanks for reading this! To end with I just want to say a thanks to the community because we're (yes I consider myself to be a part of the community, feels weird to thank myself but yeah) just so awesome. Massive thanks, this community is incredible!</p>
